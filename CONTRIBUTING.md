We are interested in revisions and extensions to the existing material. In
particular:

* Refreshing out-of-date material
* Descriptions of challenges faced by research software to use CI
* Solutions to these challenges
* Additions to the table of community examples
* Case studies showing application of CI to challenging projects

We are not interested in detailed write-ups of individual CI services unless a
compelling case can be made that they uniquely address the needs of research
software. The discussion of Anvil in the current document is a version of this.

Approval and incorporation of contributions is at the discretion of
the [editorial team](CODEOWNERS).
