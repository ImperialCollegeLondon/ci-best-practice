# Community Examples

To gain some insights into commonly used approaches for research software we
maintain this list of examples. To add information about your own software,
follow [this link]({{site.repo}}/edit/{{site.branch}}/{{ page.path }}) and add
an entry to the table below.

<!-- Markdown tables are too unwieldy for the amount of text here so use HTML
instead -->

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Project Name</th>
    <th>Front-end</th>
    <th>Back-end</th>
    <th>Other details</th>
    <th>URL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nektar++</td>
    <td>On-premise self-hosted GitLab server</td>
    <td>On-premise self-hosted runners</td>
    <td>On-premise chosen due to computationally intensive build and tests. Also
        supports heavy use of local build and docker caches to improve run
        times.
